## Intro!

This was mainly to create a 3D environment in HTML's Aframe, in part of the project '**Somni**' for the UCI Design a Thon 2025. 

## Notes

It relies heavily on assests made by supermedium [https://github.com/supermedium/aframe-environment-component]
Additionally, assests were downloaded off of Fab, I designed none of the 3D models.
